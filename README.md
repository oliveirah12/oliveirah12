# 👋 Hey there! I'm Matheus

I'm a fullstack developer who enjoys building useful, clean, and scalable software.  
I’ve been coding professionally since 2022, mostly in the desktop world with Delphi and C#,  
but I've also ventured into modern web development using React, .NET Core, and Node.js.

I’m passionate about learning and constantly evolving as a developer — whether it’s through courses, documentation, or getting my hands dirty solving real problems.
